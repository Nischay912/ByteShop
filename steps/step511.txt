To see the toasts , you need to put <Toaster /> at end in the App.jsx file below <Routes /> ke niche ka </div> tag there > now toasts will be working.

Now in temrinal click on + and in one do : cd frontend > npm run dev ; in other just do : np run dev for backend to run parallely too there.

SO we can test the toasts by going on website and checking the signup functionality now there.

Now we can do signup and see "user already exists" if we enter already existing mail id , else new user will be created on database mongodb.com too there now.

See the next steps now in LoginPage.jsx file now there.
