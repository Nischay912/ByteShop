Now we can go in POSTMAN and send a post request at : http://localhost:5000/api/auth/signup > with body > raw > JSON > enter name email and all and send to get success response back , can even see a error message in response if we dont enter email or skip entering password and all due to the catch block we had used in the auth.controller.js file earlier there.

After that we can see the database for the user document there too ; we can manually make a user there with role "admin" too ; as we are owner of the database : lol ðŸ˜†

See the next steps in step53.txt file now there.
