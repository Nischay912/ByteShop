We can have CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) error now as our frontend and backend are on different ports ; Browsers enforce the same-origin policy, which blocks requests from one origin to another unless explicitly allowed.

To fix this , we can go in vite.config.js file > put there : 

    server:{
        proxy:{
            "/api": {
                target: "http://localhost:5000",
            }
        }
    }

By doing this : Any request from your frontend like fetch('/api/products') will be forwarded to http://localhost:5000/api/products and so on..... ; and now : No CORS errors will occur because the browser thinks itâ€™s calling the same origin.

See the next steps in step511.txt file now there.
