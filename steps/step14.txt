Now lets setup the database , so for that lets go on mongodb atlas website > click on the top left down-arrow there > create a project there > project name > now we can do create project next and done > create cluster > choose FREE > create deployment > then : copy the username password > creat databse user > choose connection method > drivers > copy connection string and paste in env file as environment variable there.

If you keep as : what you copied ; then database name will be set by default to "test" so lets set it to "byteshopDb" by entering it after ".net/"  there.

Then go in > network access > add ip address > allow access anywhere > confirm

See the next steps now in db.js file now there.
